# HandNumberRecognizer

The project uses TensorFlow's Object Detection API to train a deep learning model that can detect and recognize hand numbers from input images or video streams. This involves collecting and preprocessing a dataset of hand number images, selecting a pre-trained object detection model, and evaluating the model's accuracy and performance on input images and real time stream.
